# Agricultural-Production-Optimization-Engine
   As we all know that agriculture depends largely on the nature of soil and the climatic conditions and many a times, we face unpredictable changes in climate like,       non-seasonal rainfall or heat waves or fluctuations in humidity levels, etc. and all such events cause a great loss to our farmers and farming, because of which they     are not able to utilize their agricultural land to it's fullest.So to solve all such problems, I have build a Machine Learning Model by the virtue of which we can help   farmers, optimize the agricultural production, because this predictive model will help them understand that for a particular soil & given climatic condition, which       crop will be best suitable for the harvest.
